# Project Salsa

How to Get the Project Up and Running
==============================================================
In order to get the project up and running, you must first install Android Studio from here: https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html. Once this has been completed, unzip and then open "AppDemo1.iml" file in Android Studio. You may then build the project and/or run it in the Android emulator. 

Alternatively, you may download the .apk file (app-release2) and sideload it onto your Android device. In order to do this, transfer the .apk file to your Android phone. Go into your phone and tap on the file. For many phones, you will need to check the "Install from Unknown Sources" under the Security settings tab in Android (5.0 and above). This should prompt installation, and tap the "install" button to get the app installed on your phone. You may run the app from the app drawer.

Note: This software only works with devices running Android, and is only designed for mobile use.
